suspicious_IP.txt
  - A text file containing blacklisted IPs fetched by downloader.py.
  - Each line contains one IP address to monitor against.

suspicious_IP_Preapred.txt
  - A text file containing blacklisted IPs fetched by downloader.py.
  - Each line contains one IP address to monitor against.
  - Has comments and blank space removed
